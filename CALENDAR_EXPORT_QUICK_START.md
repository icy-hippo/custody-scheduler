- Verify it's a .ics file
- Try importing in web version of the app instead
- Check file isn't corrupted (re-download)
- Ensure you have editing permissions on the calendar

### Events Don't Show Up
- Make sure the calendar is enabled/visible in your app
- Check the date range (our exports start from today forward)
- Verify the time zone is correct
- Try refreshing your calendar app

### Missing Details
- Some calendar apps don't display all fields
- Check the event details in your calendar app
- Details like notes are usually in the event description

## 🔄 Updating Events

**Important:** Calendar exports are one-time snapshots. To keep your calendar in sync:

1. When you add new events in HarmonyHub → Re-export
2. When custody changes → Update and re-export
3. Use the same calendar for updates or delete the old one first
